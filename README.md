# Welcome to Tom's GitHub!
Hi, I'm Thomas Wallsmith (but you can call me Tom). I'm a software developer currently attending the University of Central Florida here in beautiful Orlando, Florida.

I'm always looking for exciting projects to work on. If you'd like to reach out, feel free to shoot me an email at `thomaswallsmith@gmail.com`.

Feel free to take a look around my profile, I have a lot of fun projects laying around. I have a good amount of experience with TypeScript and related frameworks, and enjoy designing efficient systems and elegant websites.
