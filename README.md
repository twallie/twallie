# Welcome to Tom's GitHub!
Hi, I'm Thomas Wallsmith (but you can call me Tom). I'm a software developer currently attending the University of Central Florida here in beautiful Orlando, Florida.

I'm always looking for exciting contribute to become a part of. If you'd like to reach out, feel free to shoot me an email at `thomaswallsmith@gmail.com`.

Feel free to take a look around my profile, I have a lot of fun projects laying around. I have a good amount of experience with TypeScript and related frameworks, and enjoy designing efficient and productive systems and elegant websites.
